<br>
<h style="font-size:64px; font-family:'Segoe UI Symbol'; color:rgb(255,0,0); font:'Segoe UI Symbol'">WHAT IS BLOOD DONATION?</h><br><br>
<p>A blood donation occurs when a person voluntarily has blood drawn and used for transfusions. Donation may be of whole blood (WB), or of specific components directly (the latter called apheresis). 
Blood banks often participate in the collection process as well as the procedures that follow it.</p>
    <h style="font-size:64px; font-family:'Segoe UI Symbol'; color:rgb(255,0,0); font:'Segoe UI Symbol'">WHAT WE ARE?</h><br><br>
    <p> This Website was found 26 years ago, under the blessing of Mr. Saksham Oberoi who himself had faced the tough times when he had such difficulty finding the blood needed for his mother's surgery.
    <br>
    From that day onwards he decided that he will not let other people uffer the same fate and decided to make a change himself by starting this website to help people in need and to ake it easier for them when tough times arrive so they only have to worry about well being of their loved ones and nothing else.<br> 
    </p>
